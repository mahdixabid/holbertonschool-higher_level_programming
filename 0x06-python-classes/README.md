# Python Objects and Classes
##### Python is an object oriented programming language. Unlike procedure oriented programming, where the main emphasis is on functions, object oriented programming stresses on objects.

##### An object is simply a collection of data (variables) and methods (functions) that act on those data. Similarly, a class is a blueprint for that object.

##### We can think of class as a sketch (prototype) of a house. It contains all the details about the floors, doors, windows etc. Based on these descriptions we build the house. House is the object.

##### As many houses can be made from a house's blueprint, we can create many objects from a class. An object is also called an instance of a class and the process of creating this object is called instantiation.

### Defining a Class in Python
##### Like function definitions begin with the def keyword in Python, class definitions begin with a class keyword.

##### The first string inside the class is called docstring and has a brief description about the class. Although not mandatory, this is highly recommended.

##### Here is a simple class definition.

###### class MyNewClass:
   ###### '''This is a docstring. I have created a new class'''
  ######  pass
