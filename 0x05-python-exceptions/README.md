# Python Try Except
#### The try block lets you test a block of code for errors.
<br>
#### The except block lets you handle the error.
<br>
#### The finally block lets you execute code, regardless of the result of the try- and except blocks.

# Exception Handling
#### When an error occurs, or exception as we call it, Python will normally stop and generate an error message.
